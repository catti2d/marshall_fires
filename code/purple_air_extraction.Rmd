Import the shapefiles that were downloaded from the different city GIS portals. All of this data is stored in the `/GIS_inputs_destruction_fireboundary/` directory.
```{r}

# Download AQ data 
We are using the `bjzresc` package to download the Purple Air sensor data for the region we created above.

This function will get a list of current Purple Air sensors & their locations. We then intersect this list with the municipal boundary geometry we created to get a list of all the sensors within our area of interest. These sensors all have an ID associated with them, which we will then use to download the data for the time period we want.
```{r}
## use bjzresc package to get list of purple air sensors; save to df instead of csv
pa_download = getPurpleairLst(output.path = NULL)
```

Here we are intersecting the sensor list with our geometry to find sensors within the fire area.
```{r}
## Intersect municipal boundaries with PA sensors

# remove null Lat/Long PA sensors -- important to creating spatial dataframe
pa_download = pa_download[complete.cases(pa_download[c("Lat","Lon")]),]

# check that it worked
sum(is.na(pa_download[c("Lat", "Lon")]))

# create spatial dataframe, set CRS to match muni boundaries
pa_download_spatial = pa_download %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("Lon", "Lat")) %>% 
  st_set_crs(prg)

# check CRS
raster::crs(pa_download_spatial)

# intersect PA download area and fire affected area to download sensors
fire_affected_sensors = st_intersection(pa_download_spatial, st_buffer(surrounding_area, 0))

# get sensor IDs for sensors in fire affected area
fire_area_sensor_IDs = fire_affected_sensors$ID

# filter original dataframe to include only sensors in fire affected area
(fire_area_sensors = pa_download[pa_download$ID %in% fire_area_sensor_IDs, ])
```

For the next chunk of code to run, if on a Windows machine you **must** do the following:
1. In the console, run `trace("purpleairDownload", edit=TRUE)`
2. A window will pop up with the source code for the download function
```{r eval=F}
# download purple air data -- TAKES A LONG TIME TO RUN SO BE READY FOR THAT
## output path is a folder that stores a csv for each sensor for the target time period
## average means that data is averaged for 10-minute intervals
## indoor = TRUE includes indoor sensor observations

# for windows machines only
# the following line will create a local 4-node snow cluster
#workers = makeCluster(4, type="SOCK", outfile="Log.txt")
#registerDoParallel(workers)

```

```{r}
