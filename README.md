# marshall_fires
AQ data repository for Marshall Firest project

## Files
- [Methods.docx](/Methods.docx): a file documenting our methods of analysis (hopefully for publication)
- [marshall0.qgz](/marshall0.qgz): QGIS map showing burn area, damaged & destroyed buildings, and sensors
- [smoke-affected-parcels.qgz](/smoke-affected-parcels.qgz): QGIS project with complete Boulder County parcel data, and imported smoke data from the time period the fire was burning. TO DO: look at types of buildings on each parcel & more closely examine areas that were smoke-affected.

### code
Each .Rmd file has a corresponding .html file which is the knitted, complete version of that file.
- [purple_air_extraction.Rmd](/code/purple_air_extraction.Rmd): script used to download the Purple Air sensor data (NOT WORKING)
- [clean_AQ.Rmd](/code/clean_AQ.Rmd): script used to clean & correct the PA data
- [visualization.Rmd](/code/visualization.Rmd): script used to analyze and create visualizations of the data
- [code-help.docx](/code/code-help.docx): written instructions stepping through each of the 3 scripts explaining how they work

### fire_counties_PAs
Each file in this directory is the data for an individual sensor that was downloaded.

### images
- outputs from the visualization.Rmd script, many of the images are from older iterations of the script

### intermediary_outputs
